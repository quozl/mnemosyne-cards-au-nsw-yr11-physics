sound waves are	vibrations of particles in a medium
propagation is the	movement of waves in a medium
sound waves without a medium, such as a vacuum	cannot propagate
as the frequency of a sound wave increases, so to does	the pitch
as the amplitude of a sound wave increases, so to does	the volume, or loudness
when a sound wave is reflected, the reflected wave is	an echo
an echo is a sound wave that has been	reflected
superposition is	addition of waves
addition of waves is	superposition
for two waves, if they are in phase it means	the wave peaks are aligned
for two waves, if they are out of phase it means	the peaks of one wave are aligned with the troughs of the other
combining waves that are in phase results in amplitude	increase
combining waves that are out of phase results in amplitude	decrease
a microphone converts a sound wave into	a varying voltage
a sound wave can be converted into a varying voltage using a	microphone
a speaker converts a varying voltage into	a sound wave
a varying voltage can be converted to a sound wave using a	speaker
an oscilloscope can be used to show a	varying voltage, from a microphone, or to a speaker
an oscilloscope showing a wave has an x axis that represents	time
an oscilloscope showing a wave has an y axis that represents	amplitude
a tuning fork sound wave on an oscilloscope has the shape of a	sine-wave
sound waves can be studied with	a microphone connected to an oscilloscope, or an app that simulates the same
electromagnetic spectrum radiation types in increasing wavelength order are	gamma, x, ultraviolet, visible, infra-red, micro, radio
all electromagnetic waves propagate without	a medium
electromagnetic waves without a medium, such as a vacuum	still propagate
speed of light in a vacuum is	3 x 10⁸ m s⁻¹
electromagnetic waves are producted as a result of	alternating electric and magnetic fields
wavelengths of electromagnetic waves commonly used for communication include	radio, micro, infra-red, visible, and ultraviolet
penetrating power of electromagnetic wave is determined by	its interaction with the materials it is incident upon
longer wavelength electromagnetic radiation	more penetrating than shorter wavelength electromagnetic radiation
drop-off in intensity of electromagnetic radiation is proportional to	the inverse of the square of the distance from its source
modulation is	addition of a signal to an electromagnetic wave
frequency modulation is	varying the frequency of an electromagnetic wave in order to add a signal
amplitude modulation is	varying the amplitude of an electromagnetic wave in order to add a signal
protons have a charge which is	positive
electrons have a charge which is	negative
assuming no other forces, like charges experience a force that	repels
assuming no other forces, unlike charges experience a force that	attracts
SI unit of electric charge is the	coulomb (C)
the unit coulomb (C) is the SI unit of	electric charge
positively charged bodies have an electron	deficiency
negatively charged bodies have an electron	excess
in charged bodies, a deficiency of electrons means a	positive charge
in charged bodies, an excess of electrons means a	negative charge
bodies can be given an electrostatic charge by	friction, contact and induction
induction, contact, and friction may all give a body an	electrostatic charge
an electric field is a region where an electric charge	experiences a force
an electric charge will experiencing a force in an	electric field
every electric charge is surrounded by an	electric field
an electric field surrounds every	electric charge
electric field strength at a point is defined as the	force per unit charge on a positive charge placed at the point
the direction of the electric field strength at a point is	the direction of the force on a positive charge placed at the point
the direction of an electric field surrounding a positive charge is	away from the charge
the direction of an electric field surrounding a negative charge is	towards the charge
a charge in an electric field has	electric potential energy
a positive charge moved in the direction of an electric field has its electric potential energy	decreased
a negative charge moved in the opposite direction to that of an electric field has its electric potential energy	decreased
the potential difference between two points in an electric field is the change in	electric potential per coulomb when a charge moves between the two points
SI unit of potential difference is the	volt (V)
the unit volt (V) is the SI unit of	potential difference
one volt is equivalent to one	joule per coulomb
a joule per coulomb is equivalent to	one volt
an electric current is a net movement of electric charge under the influence of	an electric field
SI unit of current is	ampere (A)
ampere (A) is the SI unit of	current
one ampere is equivalent to	one coulomb per second
a coulomb per second is equivalent to	one ampere
ohms law, in terms of resistance	r equals v on i
ohms law, in terms of voltage	v equals r times i
ohms law, in terms of current	i equals v on r
ohms law, current is represented by the letter	i
ohms law, the letter i represents	current
