protons have a charge which is	positive
electrons have a charge which is	negative
assuming no other forces, like charges experience a force that	repels
assuming no other forces, unlike charges experience a force that	attracts
SI unit of electric charge is the	coulomb (C)
the unit coulomb (C) is the SI unit of	electric charge
positively charged bodies have an electron	deficiency
negatively charged bodies have an electron	excess
in charged bodies, a deficiency of electrons means a	positive charge
in charged bodies, an excess of electrons means a	negative charge
bodies can be given an electrostatic charge by	friction, contact and induction
induction, contact, and friction may all give a body an	electrostatic charge
an electric field is a region where an electric charge	experiences a force
an electric charge will experiencing a force in an	electric field
every electric charge is surrounded by an	electric field
an electric field surrounds every	electric charge
electric field strength at a point is defined as the	force per unit charge on a positive charge placed at the point
the direction of the electric field strength at a point is	the direction of the force on a positive charge placed at the point
the direction of an electric field surrounding a positive charge is	away from the charge
the direction of an electric field surrounding a negative charge is	towards the charge
a charge in an electric field has	electric potential energy
a positive charge moved in the direction of an electric field has its electric potential energy	decreased
a negative charge moved in the opposite direction to that of an electric field has its electric potential energy	decreased
the potential difference between two points in an electric field is the change in	electric potential per coulomb when a charge moves between the two points
SI unit of potential difference is the	volt (V)
the unit volt (V) is the SI unit of	potential difference
one volt is equivalent to one	joule per coulomb
a joule per coulomb is equivalent to	one volt
an electric current is a net movement of electric charge under the influence of	an electric field
SI unit of current is	ampere (A)
ampere (A)	SI unit of current is
one ampere is equivalent to	one coulomb per second
a coulomb per second is equivalent to	one ampere
